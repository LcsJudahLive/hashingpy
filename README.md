# hashingpy

Just a little script to make a comparison between three different hash algorithms. Using Pyplot to render the charts.

Requirements:

[+] matplotlib
[+] numpy

You can install it using "pip install <package-name>"


The reason why I'm not using threads is because it can be harmful for time measure purposes.
