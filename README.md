# hashingpy

Just a little script to make a comparison between three different hash algorithms. Using Pyplot to render the charts.

Requirements:

[+] matplotlib
[+] numpy

You can install  using "sudo pip install matplotlib" and "sudo pip install 
numpy" (Probably NumPy comes by standard into the Python libs)


The reason why I'm not using threads is because it can be harmful for time measure purposes.
